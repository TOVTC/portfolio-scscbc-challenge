# Personal Portfolio - TOVTC
Welcome to my first official webpage - which unfortunately features me. This webste was created for the Week 2 challenge for the SCSCBC.

## About This Repository
This website was created to host a collection of my past and current web development projects, along with some of my professional demographic information. I do not have a lot of coding experience and am not yet comfortable with putting much of my personal information on this site, so some fields on this webpage and its extended documents have been replaced with placeholder information (at least temporarily).
