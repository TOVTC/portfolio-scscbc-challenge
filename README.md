# Personal Portfolio - TOVTC
Welcome to my first official webpage - which unfortunately features me. This webste was created for the Week 2 challenge for the SCSCBC.

## About This Repository
This website was created to host a collection of my past and current web development projects, along with some of my professional demographic information. I do not have a lot of coding experience and am not yet comfortable with putting much of my personal information on this site, so some fields on this webpage and its extended documents have been replaced with placeholder information (at least temporarily).

## Assignment Information - Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio
### User Story
AS AN employer</br>
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples</br>
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position</br>

### Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work</br>
WHEN I load their portfolio</br>
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them</br>
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation</br>
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section</br>
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work</br>
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications</br>
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application</br>
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others</br>
WHEN I click on the images of the applications</br>
THEN I am taken to that deployed application</br>
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices</br>
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport</br>
